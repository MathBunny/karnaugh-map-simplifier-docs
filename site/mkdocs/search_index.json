The purpose of this website is to provide documentation to both developers and to users.  \n\n\nHistory and Objective\n\n\nThe purpose of this software is to provide a collection of tools for engineers to simplify logical expressions and to visualize the results in a Karnaugh Map. There are two versions of the software. The first version, which was started in 2015 used Java Swing and supported up to four variable visual expression simplification. In the summer of 2017, a new version started development which is being made in JavaFX. \n\n\nFuture Goals\n\n\nThe ultimate goal for this project is to become the standard industry tool in working with boolean algebra expressions. This includes simplification of large expressions, and working on converting expressions between different forms.",
